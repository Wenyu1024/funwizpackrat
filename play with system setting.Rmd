## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



```{r}
#versionInfo() not working
version
RStudio.Version()
```
```{r}
w <- .libPaths() #
```


#check the installed packages
```{r}
sessionInfo()
w <- installed.packages()
```


try a projectwise package management packrat
I can choose to use it or not, if I dont create a packrat project then I will be using the global libraries. I think this make sense.

The only question is that if for project
```{r}
install.packages("packrat")
getwd()
dir.create("try_packrat_project")
list.files()
setwd(dir = 
        "try_packrat_project")

library(packrat)
packrat::init()
```
